VISUALIZATION:
On click of a certain position, the nearby 8 tiles will transform in scorched background to mimic the affect of burning.
Nearby entities that have health (e.g trees, saplings, lizards) will disappear (killed by the burning)


EFFECT:
If the click is within the proximity of a dude, the dude will transform into knight with the goal of hunting the lizards spawned by fairies.
When at least one dude has transformed into a knight, the fairies will start spawning lizards instead of saplings.


NEW ENTITY:
Lizards are created by the fairies. They move similarly to the fairies (using pathing strategy) and also do hve health that will increase each type it executes its own activity.
Lizards will disappear after health = healthLimit to prevent overpopulation.
